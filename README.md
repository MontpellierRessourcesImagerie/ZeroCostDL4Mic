# ZeroCostDL4Mic: exploiting Google Colab to develop a free and open-source toolbox for Deep-Learning in microscopy

_**Tl;dr**_: this [**wiki page**][wikiPage] has everything you need to get started.

## What is this?

ZeroCostDL4Mic is a collection of self-explanatory Jupyter Notebooks for [**Google Colab**][1] that features an **easy-to-use graphical user interface**. They are meant to quickly get you started on learning to use deep-learning for microscopy. Google Colab itself **provides the computations resources needed at no-cost**. **ZeroCostDL4Mic** is designed for researchers that have little or no coding expertise to quickly test, train and use popular Deep-Learning networks.

## Who is it for?

Any researcher interested in microscopy, independent of their background training. **ZeroCostDL4Mi**c is designed for anyone with little or no coding expertise to quickly test, train and use popular Deep-Learning networks used to process microscopy data.
